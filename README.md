# ‚öæ Arb-Bot ‚Äì Sports Betting Arbitrage Calculator  

This is a project I built to explore how arbitrage betting works and to get more hands-on experience with Django and React. The app pulls sportsbook odds, runs the math in the backend, and shows users where they can lock in a guaranteed profit.  

It‚Äôs split into two parts:  
- **Backend (Django + DRF):** handles odds, calculations, and exposes an API.  
- **Frontend (React):** a clean interface where you enter your budget/odds and instantly see the results.
